## Problem 42
***Asked by Google.***
### Task
**Given a list of integers S and a target number k, write a function that returns a subset of S that adds up to k. If such a subset cannot be made, then return null.**
**Integers can appear more than once in the list. You may assume all numbers in the list are positive.**
**For example, given S = [12, 1, 61, 5, 9, 2] and k = 24, return [12, 9, 2, 1] since it sums up to 24.**

>***Try this Approach: Sort the list and add sum each element one by one to the SUM, untill sum becomes equal to that K. Else if SUM is less than K and all elements are used then return NULL. Else if SUM is greater than K, then also return NULL.***
