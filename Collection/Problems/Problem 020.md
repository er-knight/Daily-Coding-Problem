Asked by Google.

Given two singly linked lists that intersect at some point, find the intersecting node. The lists are non-cyclical.  
For example, given A &rArr; 3 &rarr; 7 &rarr; 8 &rarr; 10 and B &rArr; 99 &rarr; 1 &rarr; 8 &rarr; 10, return the node with value 8.

In this example, assume nodes with the same value are the exact same node objects.

Do this in `O(M+N)` time (where M and N are the lengths of the lists) and constant space.
