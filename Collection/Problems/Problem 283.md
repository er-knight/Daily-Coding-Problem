Asked by Google.

A [regular number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_number) in mathematics is defined as one which evenly divides some power of `60`. Equivalently, we can say that a regular number is one whose only prime divisors are `2`, `3`, and `5`.

These numbers have had many applications, from helping ancient Babylonians keep time to tuning instruments according to the diatonic scale.

Given an integer `N`, write a program that returns, in order, the first `N` regular numbers.
