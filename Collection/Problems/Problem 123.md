Given a string, return whether it represents a number. Here are the different kinds of numbers:
```
1. "10", a positive integer
2. "-10", a negative integer
3. "10.1", a positive real number
4. "-10.1", a negative real number
5. "1e5", a number in scientific notation
```
And here are examples of non-numbers:
```
1. "a"
2. "x 1"
3. "a -2"
4. "-"
```
