## Problem 34
***Asked by Quora.***
### Task
**Given a string, find the palindrome that can be made by inserting the fewest number of characters as possible anywhere in the word. If there is more than one palindrome of minimum length that can be made, return the lexicographically earliest one (the first one alphabetically).**
### Sample Input
**race**
### Sample Output
**ecarace**
### Explanation
**three more letters can be added to "race" (which is the smallest amount to make a palindrome). There are seven other palindromes that can be made from "race" by adding three letters, but "ecarace" comes first alphabetically.**
### Sample Input
**google**
### Sample Output
**elgoogle**
